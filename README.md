# 4D-Connect-4
I had fun playing 4d connect 4 here: https://ericwieser.me/games/4d/
But it stopped working.
So naturally I coded it myself in c

Possible features to add:
 - Show winning moves to help people understand
 - Allow rotation
 - Computer player?
    - block player when they had 2/3 in a row
    - add to row that has own piece and isn't blocked if possible
    - ~~play in position with as little enemy pieces around it as possible~~
